"""
This migration alters the TriggeredResponse object to use a foreign
key reference to Guild instead of storing a Guild's ID as an 
integer.

1. Add the FK(Guild) to the TriggeredResponse table
2. 
For every triggered response:
    find the guild which matches the stored guild_id
    store the guild in the new FK field
3. Remove the guild_id field from the TriggeredResponse table
